            This is a free and comprehensive guide for students in AP Computer Science Principles trying to get a 5 on the APCS Principles exam! The purpose of this website is to help you get the 5 you need to help you understand the fundamentals of computer science principles and perhaps get college credit! As someone who took the APCS Principles test during the 2017-2018 school year, this test was relatively new and there were few guides on how to successfully get a 5, so this is my gift to you! *Thanks To 1stWebDesigner for the website template and instructions on website creation!* Images used are royalty free and examples of the performance tasks are the ones I created.

Some colleges accept AP Tests as a form of gaining college credit while others do not, and what is worse is that some colleges do not accept a 3 (passing); they want a 4 or 5 in order to reward credit.
